# Threax.NJsonSchema
This is a copy of NJsonSchema 9.10.49, which is used in the Threax.AspNetCore.Halcyon.Ext project for schema generation. This was done mostly to stabalize the codebase.

It is based on this github version: https://github.com/RicoSuter/NJsonSchema/releases/tag/NSwag-Build-1820

I want to thank Rico Suter for the excellent library. I just have too many custom needs to use it as is. By forking and namespacing it the main library can still be used by client apps.
